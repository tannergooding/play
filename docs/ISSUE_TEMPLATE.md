### Code of Conduct

Play and everyone contributing (this includes issues, pull requests, the
wiki, etc) must abide by the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at @tannergooding.

### Question

Questions are straightforward, just prefix your issue title with `[QUESTION]`
and state what you desire to be answered.

### Bug

Bugs need to be both reproducible or we need some other mechanism of being able
to debug and determine the root cause of failure. Please prefix your issue title
with `[BUG]` and fill out the following sections.

#### Description (optional)

This section should contain an expanded description of the bug, if the title is
not sufficient.

#### Reproduction Steps

This section should contain an ordered list of steps that can be used to
reproduce the bug. Ideally, you would include as much information about your
environment as possible to help use in determining the best fix for the issue.

#### Expected Behavior

This section should contain a description of the behavior that is expected.

#### Actual Behavior

This section should contain a description of the actual behavior being observed.

### Regression

Regressions are similar to bugs but represent functionality that worked in a
prior release but is no longer functioning as expected. Please prefix your issue
title with `[REGRESSION]` and fill out the same sections as for a [Bug](#bug).

### Idea

Requests would ideally always be well thought and come with a full proposal;
however, this is not always possible and sometimes you want input from others
before actually proposing something. Please prefix your issue title with
`[IDEA]` and give a brief summary of what you want.

### Proposals

proposed for inclusion in the project. Please prefix your issue title with
`[PROPOSAL]` and fill out the following sections.

#### Description (optional)

This section should contain an expanded description of the proposal, if the
title is not sufficient.

#### Rationale

things like "Why do we need this", "How will it improve a developers quality of
life", etc.

#### Proposed API

description of what each API does.
